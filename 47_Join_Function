It is used to join the elements of a list, tuple, set, etc.

What is the join method in Python?
"Join is a function in Python, that returns a string by joining the elements of an iterable, using a string or character of our choice."
Iterables can be a list, dictionary, set, tuple, or even a string itself.

Syntax:
string.join(iterable)

Note: If the iterable contains any non-string values, join() will raise a TypeError exception.

#join() with lists
numList = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
separator = ', '
print(separator.join(numList))

lst1 = ['Ram','Sam','Pam','Dam']
print(' and '.join(lst1))
