time.time():

It tells us the time in seconds that have passed since 1 January 1970.


Time.sleep():
What sleep() function does is, it delays the execution of further commands for given specific seconds. 
In simple terms, it sends the program to sleep for some defined number of seconds. 
sleep() function is mostly used in programs directly connected to the operating system and in-game development. 
It halts the program execution, giving other programs a chance to get executed simultaneously. 

time.sleep(5)
The number of seconds is sent as a parameter within parenthesis. 
The program will go to sleep for 5 seconds after getting to this line of code and will continue its execution afterward.

time localtime():
The time.localtime() is used to convert the number of seconds to local time. 
This function takes seconds as a parameter and returns the date and time in time.struct_time format. 
It is optional to pass seconds as a parameter. If seconds is not provided, the current time will be returned by time() is used.
