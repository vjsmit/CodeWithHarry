Classes & Template

A class is a collection of objects, and an object is defined as an instance of class possessing attributes. 
The object is an entity that has state and behavior.

e.g. if we have a class students, then it will only consist of students related data, such as subjects, names, attendance ratio, etc.

As procedure-oriented programming focuses on functions, object-oriented programming stresses on objects.
An object is simply a collection of data and methods.

A class is a blueprint from which objects are created.


##print(smit.__dict__) --> __dict__ is a attribute present inside a class and it returns dictionary
