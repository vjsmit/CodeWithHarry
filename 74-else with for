When we use else with for loop, the compiler will only go into the else block of code when two conditions are satisfied:

1) The loop is normally executed without any error.
2) We are trying to find an item that is not present inside the list or data structure on which we are implementing our loop

Except for these conditions, the program will ignore the else part of the program. 
For example, if we are just partially executing the loop using a break statement, then the else part will not execute. 
So, a break statement is a must if we do not want our compiler to execute the else part of the code.

We mostly use such implementations in our program when we want to encounter less logical errors and want to know that our program is functioning correctly. 
In such cases, we will most probably send a print statement inside the code, and based on its execution, we could see if our code is working correctly.
