A module can be defined as a file containing a runnable python code.
The extension used by modules in Python is .py.
Hence any simple file containing Python code can be considered as a module if its extension is .py. 
The file and module names are the same; hence we can call a module only by name without using the extension.

There are two types of modules:
Built-in
External

Built-in modules are already installed in Python by default. 
We can import a module in Python by using the import statement along with the specific module name.
We can also access the built-in module files and can read the Python code present in them. Newly integrated modules are added in Python with each update. 

Some important modules names are as follows:
calendar: used in case we are working with calendars

random: used for generating random numbers within certain defined limits

enum: used while working with enumeration class

html: for handling and manipulating code in HTML

math: for working with math functions such as sin, cos, etc.

runpy: runpy is an important module as it locates and runs python modules without importing them first

External modules:
External modules have to be downloaded externally; they are not already present like the built-in ones. 
Installing them is a rather easy task and can be done by using the command “pip install module_name” in the compiler terminal.
